# SwellForecasterV3 Project Summary

## Project Overview
SwellForecasterV3 is a complete migration of SwellForecasterV2 from OpenAI's traditional completions API to the new Assistants API. The project maintains the original multi-agent data collection architecture while introducing thread-based communication and persistent assistant management.

## Original Requirements (from PROJECT_SPECS.txt)
- Migrate to OpenAI Assistants API
- Multi-agent system for data collection
- Forecaster + Critic workflow for forecast refinement
- Thread-based communication between components
- File-based data sharing using Assistants API

## Additional User Requirements
1. Store prompts in JSON file for easy modification
2. Include failure log for data collection debugging
3. Remove version numbers from requirements.txt (pull latest)
4. Consider valuable data sources for 10-day Oahu surf forecasting
5. Emulate Pat Caldwell forecast style (user provided PDF)
6. Keep project clean - no duplicate files
7. Proper API key management from original config
8. Create comprehensive README for GitHub hosting
9. Test the system end-to-end

## Project Status: COMPLETE (Core Infrastructure)

### âœ… Completed Components

#### Phase 1: Project Setup
- Created clean SwellForecasterV3 directory structure
- Implemented config.ini with all necessary API keys
- Created config.ini.example for GitHub
- Set up 3-tier logging system (INFO/VERBOSE/DEBUG)

#### Phase 2: Assistants API Infrastructure
- **AssistantManager**: Creates and persists forecaster, critic, and data_assessment assistants
- **ThreadManager**: Manages conversation threads between components
- **FileManager**: Handles file uploads and downloads for data sharing
- JSON-based prompt configuration system

#### Phase 3: Data Collection Framework
- **FileAdapter**: Bridge between original agent architecture and Assistants API
- **DataCollector**: Orchestrates async data collection
- **BuoyAgent**: Complete implementation as example agent
- **FailureTracker**: Logs connection failures for debugging
- Placeholder agents for weather, model, and satellite data

#### Phase 4: Forecast Engine
- **ForecastEngine**: Manages forecaster/critic refinement cycles
- **DataAssessment**: Reviews collected data for quality
- Shore-specific forecast generation
- Configurable refinement cycles

#### Phase 5: Integration
- **Orchestrator**: Main entry point replacing run.py
- Command structure: `python orchestrator.py [collect|analyze|forecast|full]`
- Complete integration of all components
- Error handling and logging throughout

### Configuration Files
- `config/config.ini`: API keys and settings
- `config/config.ini.example`: Template for users
- `config/prompts.json`: Customizable assistant prompts
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies without version numbers
- `README.md`: Comprehensive documentation

### Templates
- `templates/forecast_template.md`: Basic forecast output structure

## ðŸš§ Incomplete/Placeholder Components

### Data Collection Agents
Only BuoyAgent is fully implemented. Placeholders exist for:
- **WeatherAgent**: Atmospheric data (wind, pressure, weather)
- **ModelAgent**: Wave model data (WaveWatch III, ECMWF)
- **SatelliteAgent**: Satellite imagery and analysis

### Output Formatting
- Basic markdown template exists
- No HTML generation
- No Pat Caldwell-style formatting implemented
- Simple forecast output structure

### Testing
- No unit tests created
- System not tested with actual OpenAI API calls
- No integration tests
- No performance benchmarking

## Missing Features

### Data Sources (User Requested)
For 10-day Oahu surf forecasting, these valuable sources are not yet implemented:
- PacIOOS (Pacific Islands Ocean Observing System)
- Surfline API integration
- ECMWF wave model data
- FNMOC WaveWatch III
- Local Hawaii weather stations
- Satellite-derived wave data

### Pat Caldwell Style
User provided PDF of Pat Caldwell forecasts. Implementation needed for:
- Specific formatting style
- Technical terminology usage
- Local knowledge integration
- Beach-specific forecasts

### Advanced Features
- Forecast verification/scoring
- Historical data integration
- Machine learning enhancements
- Real-time updates
- Web interface
- API endpoints

## Implementation Priority

1. **Complete Data Agents** (High Priority)
   - WeatherAgent for atmospheric conditions
   - ModelAgent for wave models
   - SatelliteAgent for imagery

2. **Test System** (High Priority)
   - Run end-to-end with actual API calls
   - Debug any issues
   - Verify data flow

3. **Pat Caldwell Formatting** (Medium Priority)
   - Study provided PDF
   - Implement formatting templates
   - Add local knowledge rules

4. **Additional Data Sources** (Medium Priority)
   - Research APIs for PacIOOS, Surfline
   - Implement new agents
   - Test data quality

5. **Testing Suite** (Low Priority)
   - Unit tests for critical components
   - Integration tests
   - Mock API responses

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
1. User initiates forecast via orchestrator
2. DataCollector dispatches agents concurrently
3. Agents collect data and save via FileAdapter
4. Files uploaded to OpenAI via FileManager
5. DataAssessment reviews data quality
6. ForecastEngine generates initial forecast
7. Critic assistant reviews and suggests improvements
8. Refinement cycles produce final forecast
9. Output saved to filesystem

### Key Design Decisions
- Thread-based communication for assistant interactions
- File-based data sharing (Assistants API requirement)
- Modular agent architecture preserved from V2
- JSON configuration for easy prompt modification
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

   cd SwellForecasterV3
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python orchestrator.py full Hawaii
   ```

2. **Implement Missing Agents**
   - Start with WeatherAgent (most critical)
   - Add ModelAgent for wave data
   - Complete SatelliteAgent

3. **Enhance Output**
   - Study Pat Caldwell PDF
   - Create proper templates
   - Add HTML generation

4. **Production Readiness**
   - Add error recovery
   - Implement retries
   - Create monitoring
   - Add unit tests

## Known Issues
- Agents beyond BuoyAgent are placeholders
- No actual API testing performed
- Output formatting is basic

## Success Metrics
- Successfully migrated to Assistants API âœ…
- Maintained modular architecture âœ…
- Added requested features (JSON prompts, failure tracking) âœ…
- Created clean, documented codebase âœ…
- Ready for testing and enhancement âœ…

The core migration is complete and the system is ready for testing and iterative improvements.
